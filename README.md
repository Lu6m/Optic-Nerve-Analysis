# Optic-Nerve-Analysis
Glaucoma is an eye disease, the result of pressure on the eye which damages the optic nerve. It can lead to permanent vision loss or blindness if left untreated.

## Goal
The goal of this project in computer vision is to try and detect the presence of a glaucoma by analysing different images of optic nerves. Usually, the black spots inside the optic nerve appear larger and with a more rough shape when deteriorated.

## Data
The data set contain 10 images of optic nerves, and 10 masks (saved as .mat) representing the areas ophthalmologists consider as the black spots of interest. 

## Getting ready with VSCode 
Open VSCode
Make sure [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/) are installed
Open a new terminal in VSCode with ctrl+shifft+Ã¹
Ask for a command prompt in the "+" space at the top right of the terminal 
Clone the git repository with `git clone *http adress*`
Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
You can now run the code with `py *filecode name*`

## Results 
All interesting results are saved in the Results directory until one solution truly stands out
